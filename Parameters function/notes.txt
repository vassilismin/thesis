### Iportant!!! each compartment has a specific index vectors Tissue_fractions, Regional_flow_fractions, Capillary_fractions and cannot be changed
# The index of each compartment:
#Rest of Body (rob) --> 1
#Heart (ht) --> 2
#Kidneys (ki) --> 3
#Brain (br) --> 4
#Spleen (spl) --> 5
#Lungs (lu) --> 6
#Liver (li) --> 7

If any of these compartments don not exist in pbpk, just give it the value NA in compartments vector, example: "Heart" = NA and it will remove it 
from the equilibriums and the corresponding V_tis, V_cap, Q will be equal to NA.
